# Dog Party - Roger Hughes

This is my first project submission while being a student at turing. The following is the Dog-Party indivdual project. This is a struggle for me. I have gotten down the very basics for CSS manipulation. S

Some key takeaways from my expierience for this project are:
1. HTML structure 
2. BEM organization
3. Workflow

Ive used this first project as an opportunity to really hammer home my worth ethic, and following a structure for my code. Something that follows a standard, but it still unique to me. 

Some things I really REALLY need to work on and study are:
1. More indepth CSS manipulation
2. Less HTML that allows for more manipulation through different CSS style sheets
3. ANYTHING to do with Javascript. 

Javascript is the only thing I have just the loosest concept on. I couldn't wrap my head around practicality, and im hoping to these upcoming lessons will give me some more context. 

Here's a screen capture of my finished dog party comp-1. It has no functioning Javascript, and once you start changing browser size, all of my painstakingly placed sections mesh in a terrible way. 



Here's a screen capture of my not even close to being finished dog party comp-2. This comes back to structing my HTML in a way that allows different CSS sheets to be plugged in without a need for HTML restructure. 



Thanks!
